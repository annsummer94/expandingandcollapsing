This document will explain how to write nested expanding code. If you have a long article with, for example, 4 sections;
and you only want people to see the next section after finish reading the previous one, then this is for you.

Let's call that expand button, "Continue". Since you have 4 sections, you would need 3 "Continue" button (the first section is already visible).

The basic code for expanding/collapsing is [expand title="Continue"]content[/expand]

If you want sub expanding within the parent above, you must name it differently, for example, "expandsub1"

So it goes like this:

[expand title="Continue"]content
[expandsub1 title="Continue"]content
[/expandsub1][/expand]

For the 4 sections, it goes like this:

[expand title="Continue"]content
[expandsub1 title="Continue"]content
[expandsub2 title="Continue"]content
[expandsub3 title="Continue"]content
[/expandsub3]
[/expandsub2]
[/expandsub1]
[/expand]

For color, font, and bolding, you can add as below for each expand:

<span style="color: #821300;"><strong><span style="font-size: 25pt;">[expand title="Continue"]</span></strong></span>content

<span style="color: #821300;"><strong><span style="font-size: 25pt;">[expandsub1 title="Continue"]</span></strong></span>content

[/expandsub1]
[/expand]
